# Example GitHub repo for Collections that don't have their own home.

There are a lot of (groups of) modules that:
* don't currently need their own release cycle
* don't have an active Working Group
* may have a working group, though they don't want the overhead of maintaining their own Repo or Collection release cycles

Collections are defined at the sub-topic level (ie mysql, gitlab, zabbix).
Directory structure that matches the previous Ansible topics (Cloud, Database, Identity, etc) is used to help organise the repo

## Example Collection

Directory: `database/mysql/` 
Collection: `community.mysql`

*WARNING* This is a proof of concept for Ansible Community Collection development workflow.

For more information see `#ansible-community` on Freenode IRC.
